  <p><em>Written by Rhodri James</em>; article also available at
<a href="https://kynesim.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/external-entity-vulnerability-in-expat.html">kynesim.blogspot.co.uk</a>.</p>
<h1>External Entity Vulnerability in Expat 2.2.0 And Earlier</h1>
<p>I'm in the intriguing position of being employed to work on a free
software project
by <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">the Linux Foundation</a>.  I'm
expanding the test coverage of the Expat library under the eagle eye
of maintainer Sebastian Pipping, which is an excellent way of
discovering how the brilliant, twisted and almost entirely
undocumented internals work.  (There will be articles.  Many articles.)</p>
<p>One thing you expect to come across when writing tests is the
occasional bug.  I came across a serious one in the parsing of
external parameter entities.  CVE-2017-9233 (to give it its formal
identification) says that bad XML in an external entity will cause the
parser to go into an infinite loop and never return control to the
application.</p>
<p>For those of you who haven't been saturated in XML terminology for the
last however long, an example is in order.  Suppose you have the
following trivial piece of XML:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ni">&lt;</span>!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM &quot;http://example.com/level1.dtd&quot;<span class="ni">&gt;</span>
<span class="ni">&lt;</span>doc/<span class="ni">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And the DTD <code>level1.dtd</code> that it reads:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ni">&lt;</span>!ELEMENT doc EMPTY<span class="ni">&gt;</span>
<span class="ni">&lt;</span>!ENTITY % e SYSTEM &quot;http://example.com/level2.ent&quot;<span class="ni">&gt;</span>
%e;
</pre></div>


<p>And the external entity definition in yet another resource, <code>level2.ent</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ni">&lt;</span>!ELEMENT el EMPTY<span class="ni">&gt;</span>
<span class="ni">&lt;</span>el/<span class="ni">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now a quick riffle through the XML standards will tell you that
ordinary elements such as <code>&lt;el&gt;</code> aren't allowed in DTDs.  All you can
legally use are the DTD declarations <code>&lt;!ELEMENT&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;!ATTLIST&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;!ENTITY&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;!NOTATION&gt;</code>.  When our entity <code>%e</code> in level.dtd gets
substituted in, it will put the <code>&lt;el/&gt;</code> element straight into the DTD,
leaving us with a malformed DTD.  The parser should detect this and
reject the whole shebang.</p>
<p>What actually happened is hard to follow in the source code.  (<em>Many</em>
articles.)  When parsing reached the 'e' of <code>&lt;el/&gt;</code>, the tokenizer
recognised it as a valid start of an ordinary element (which is true)
and returned the appropriate value, <code>XML_TOK_INSTANCE_START</code>.</p>
<p>The calling code knew how to recognise the limited number of tokens
that are legal and most of the tokens that aren't legal in a DTD, but
unfortunately it missed this specific case.  Without any better
instructions from its decision logic, the code assumed that it had
found something valid and tried tokenising again, in case there was
more text to be parsed.</p>
<p>It did this expecting that its internal pointers were updated to point
to that unparsed text.  That would have been true if it had dealt with
something legal, but since "&lt;e" isn't a legal part of a DTD the
pointers had been left alone.  The tokenizer therefore saw "&lt;e" again,
returned <code>XML_TOK_INSTANCE_START</code> again, and the whole thing repeated
until the application was killed.</p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lowest levels of the parser recognise "&lt;e" as starting an
  element.</li>
<li>The next level up correctly doesn't recognise it as a valid case</li>
<li>...but also fails to recognise it as an invalid case.</li>
<li>The parser assumes it was successful and tries again <em>on the same
  string.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Do I Care?</h2>
<p>"How does this affect me?" you may well ask.  "I don't use Expat.  I
don't even write in C.  How can I possibly be affected?"  The answer
is, you may well be using Expat unknowingly.  There are wrapper
libraries for Python, Java and many other languages for Expat.  Many
other
<a href="https://libexpat.github.io/doc/users/">application and libraries</a>
(particularly C and C++ libraries like Poco, libDOM or libwww) use
Expat under the hood.</p>
<p>The libraries often enable external entity parsing, which does
potentially allow this bug to bite your application.  Some of them
will, or used to, download the URIs for you, which is a serious
problem.  Some of the applications are just parsing local
configuration files, but even those might follow a DTD if one was
inserted into the configuration file somehow.  Other applications
explicitly use external DTDs, leaving you vulnerable if those sites
are compromised or malicious.</p>
<p>In short, it's entirely possible for you to be using Expat and not
know it.</p>
<h2>What Should I Do?</h2>
<p>First and most obviously, upgrade.  The current version of libexpat
has patched this bug, and a few other things; read the change log for
details.</p>
<p>The other thing you should always do is consider how you use your XML
parser.  I am not a security expert by any stretch of the imagination,
but even I know not to download arbitrary URIs, for example.  Reading
"https://www.w3c.org/xml/fluffy.ent" is probably safe; reading
"http://evil.haxx0rs.org/xml/i-pwn-u.dtd" probably isn't.  You should
check that any library you use doesn't automatically download
arbitrary URIs for you, and you should be careful about what URIs you
do allow to be downloaded.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>If you want a moral from this article: always test.  Murphy's Law
ensures there will always be bugs in your code, and you should make at
least some effort to find them before they annoy other people.  And if
by chance you should be one of those people annoyed by a bug, let the
author know.  He or she will usually be glad for the feedback and want
it fixed as much as you do!</p>
